## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
In cancer, there are over 200 different forms. Out of 200, melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The diagnostic procedure for melanoma starts with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Melanoma skin cancer is highly curable if it gets identified at the early stages. The first step of Melanoma skin cancer diagnosis is to conduct a visual examination of the skin's affected area. Dermatologists take the dermatoscopic images of the skin lesions by the high-speed camera, which have an accuracy of 65-80% in the melanoma diagnosis without any additional technical support. With further visual examination by cancer treatment specialists and dermatoscopic images, the overall prediction rate of melanoma diagnosis raised to 75-84% accuracy. The project aims to build an automated classification system based on image processing techniques to classify skin cancer using skin lesions images.

- What is the background of your project?
Among all the skin cancer type, melanoma is the least common skin cancer, but it is responsible for **75%** of death [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification, 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification). Being a less common skin cancer type but is spread very quickly to other body parts if not diagnosed early. The **International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)** is facilitating skin images to reduce melanoma mortality. Melanoma can be cured if diagnosed and treated in the early stages. Digital skin lesion images can be used to make a teledermatology automated diagnosis system that can support clinical decision.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
The first step to identify whether the skin lesion is malignant or benign for a dermatologist is to do a skin biopsy. In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. The current process takes almost a week or more, starting from getting a dermatologist appointment to getting a biopsy report. This project aims to shorten the current gap to just a couple of days by providing the predictive model using **Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD)**. The approach uses **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images. This reduction of a gap has the opportunity to impact millions of people positively.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
 The dataset consists of images in various file format. The raw images are in **DICOM (Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine)**, containing patient metadata and skin lesion images. DICOM is a commonly used file format in medical imaging. Additionally, the dataset also includes images in **TFRECORDS (TensorFlow Records)** and JPEG format.

Furthermore, thirty-three thousand are in training set among the forty-four thousand images and around eleven thousand in the test set. However, our quick analysis found a significant class imbalance in the training dataset. Thirty-two thousand are labelled as **benign (Not Cancerous)** and only five hundred marked as **malignant (Cancerous)**. That is, the training set contains only Â±1.76% of malignant images (Figure 1). Along with the patient's images, the dataset also has a CSV file containing a detail about patient-level contextual information, which includes patient id, gender, patient age, location of benign/malignant site, and indicator of malignancy for the imaged lesion.

## Conclusions
- One of the deadliest cancer forms is melanoma, and the proportion of people getting affected by melanoma is increasing rapidly. To make the solution available to the public and dermatologists, we have successfully integrated the optimised model with our CAD system. 

The EfficientNet model is proved to be a better network for the skin cancer dataset. The network can generalise well on the dataset and have higher validation accuracy (Table 3 and Figure 22). Plus, the ensemble of the model helps to reduce model prediction error and biases. The model prediction error can be further reduced if the ensemble is more significant with varied configuration, as proposed in Table 4.

Along with optimising the training process, an equal amount of time is spent optimising the predictions. Based on the three core pillars of model serving, we have tick two of them: model size and latency. The last pillar (Prediction throughput) comes into account when the predictions are performed online over the internet. The prediction throughput measures how many predictions the system can perform in a given timeframe. The prediction throughput is beyond the project's scope but should be considered when deploying the model on the web.
